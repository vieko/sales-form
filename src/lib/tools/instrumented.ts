/**
 * AI tools with enrichment logging
 * 
 * These are the original AI SDK tools, used directly with the enrichment engine.
 * Tool usage logging is handled at the AI SDK level using generateText() result data,
 * providing more detailed and accurate logging than individual tool wrappers.
 * 
 * See: enrichment-engine.ts -> logToolCalls() for the logging implementation

## Lead Triage + Enrichment

### WHAT IT IS

- After submission, AI runs server-side to enrich and classify leads for GTM
  teams automatically.

### HOW IT WORKS

- Use the email domain and company website to auto-enrich lead data (e.g., size,
  industry, tech stack).
- Summarize the “How can I help?” free-text into a concise, structured intent
  (e.g., "Requesting Enterprise trial" or "Evaluating for a small team POC").
- Tag and route leads based on inferred value (e.g., fast-track enterprise-ready
  prospects). Push the enriched metadata directly to CRM.

### WHY IT’S VALUABLE

- Saves GTM time by eliminating manual triage.
- Increases lead quality visibility (less noise for sales reps).
- (I think) A practical AI use aligned with GTM workflows.
